# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-21)

**Core value:** One tool that takes a modder from raw idea to deployed, in-game-verified SWG mod without leaving the app — and without restarting the client to see a change.
**Current focus:** Phase 00 — toolchain-de-risk-app-shell

## Current Position

Phase: 00 (toolchain-de-risk-app-shell) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5
Status: Ready to execute

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Roadmap-shaping decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Hard dependency chain 0 -> 1 -> 2 (no mesh without TRE without IFF) is non-negotiable; it is the spine.
- [Roadmap]: Live-injection (Phase 3) and Blender bridge (Phase 6) branch off EARLY and stay OFF the critical path — never serialize the differentiator behind the format tower.
- [Roadmap]: The byte-exact verification harness is a Phase 1 keystone that recurs as a standing gate in every format phase (2, 5, 6, 7) — budget the round-trip tax per phase.
- [Roadmap]: Electron security + COOP/COEP cross-origin isolation + `contracts/` are front-loaded into Phase 0 (cheap before features accrete, HIGH recovery cost after).
- [Phase ?]: D-WORKSPACE: pnpm workspace with @electron/rebuild overridden to ^4.0.0 via pnpm-workspace.yaml overrides
- [Phase ?]: D-TSCONFIG: tsconfig.base.json uses baseUrl+ignoreDeprecations:6.0 for TypeScript 6 path aliases
- [Phase ?]: Prevents Forge from pulling breaking v5+
- [Phase ?]: TypeScript 6 deprecates paths-without-baseUrl; override silences it
- [Phase ?]: check-prereqs.js emits WARN not error; FND-02 unblocked on Node 24

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Standing risk]: Every binary format layout in `docs/` is an AI-proposed hypothesis (rated LOW—VERIFY). No parser merges without a cited `swg-client-v2` source + byte-exact round-trip on a real asset.
- [Phase 3/5]: Live-injection pointer/offset discovery is per-client-build and effort-unbounded — mine Utinni, use runtime AOB resolution; treat magnitude as a planning unknown.
- [Phase 0]: Electron Forge + Vite + native-addon integration risk — decide Forge-vs-`electron-vite` deliberately in Phase 0; don't switch mid-roadmap.
